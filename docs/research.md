# Pipoca research notes

> Status: research snapshot. These facts informed the vision but do not dictate Pipoca's implementation.

## Claude Projects

Official documentation describes a Project as one coordinating conversation plus full thread sessions.

Documented properties:

- Each Thread is a separate Claude Code session with its own context window.
- Each cloud Thread clones the Project repositories into its own cloud sandbox and works on its own branch. Project Threads do not share one checkout through worktrees.
- Threads can use subagents, agent teams, loops, and workflows inside their own Session.
- The coordinator sees Thread reports rather than every internal step.
- Project instructions are supplied to the coordinator and each new Thread.
- Project memory is stored as files. Each cloud Thread reads the `MEMORY.md` index at startup and opens other memory files when needed.
- Uploaded Project files are copies readable under `/mnt/project-files`.
- Files produced by Threads appear in the Project Library.
- The documentation does not specify locking, versioning, or merge semantics for concurrent Project-memory updates.

## Claude cloud Environments

An Environment is reusable configuration selected when a cloud Session starts. It is not a Project and is not a shared writable Workspace.

Documented Environment responsibilities include:

- network access level and domain policy;
- environment variables;
- network secrets held outside an Anthropic-hosted Session VM;
- a setup script;
- cached filesystem contents such as installed packages, files, and Docker images;
- organization or personal availability.

The setup cache keeps filesystem changes, packages, and pulled images, but not running processes. Project Threads use the Environment selected in Project settings.

Anthropic-hosted Sessions pause after a short idle period with files saved. A paused VM may later be reclaimed; reopening then provisions fresh compute and restores conversation history, but not running subagents, shell commands, or background loops. Public documentation does not promise that arbitrary uncommitted filesystem state survives full reclamation.

## Claude self-hosted Environments

Claude's self-hosted design separates the hosted control plane from customer-operated runners:

- Sessions target an Environment runner pool, not one named runner.
- Runners register outbound, poll for work, claim a Session lease, and stream events.
- One runner may have capacity for several Sessions owned by the same user.
- Anthropic recommends fresh capacity-one containers or VMs for stronger production isolation, although one runner can technically host several Sessions for the same owner.
- Each Session is a child process with per-session directories or worktrees.
- A Session may resume on another runner, so runners in one Environment must be configured consistently.

## Pi capabilities

Pi already provides the main Session-runtime primitives Pipoca needs:

- persistent native JSONL Sessions;
- full independent `AgentSession` instances;
- SDK and long-lived RPC integration;
- explicit working directories;
- session open, continue, fork, and branch operations;
- lifecycle and streaming events;
- steering and queued follow-ups;
- extension loading and permission dialogs;
- model, effort, tool, and skill selection;
- compaction and settlement boundaries;
- nested subagents and workflows.

Pipoca still needs to supply the distributed layer: Environment and Profile registries, Provider Agents, scheduling and leases, Workspace provisioning, event replay, Projects and Thread reports, shared memory, artifact publication, and the browser control plane.

### pi-durable

[`@earendil-works/pi-durable`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/durable) is a second Pi harness, separate from `pi-coding-agent`. It commits entries, task checkpoints and documents atomically before anything is shown, so a process that dies mid-turn resumes where it stopped. Tool intent is stored before a tool runs: a tool marked replay-safe reruns, and any other gets an `interrupted` result with the output so far. It also has idempotent submits by `requestId`, conversations owned by tasks with abort cascading bottom-up, durable sleeps with a wake hook for hosts that hibernate, and a guard that parks a task after repeated crashes.

Pipoca does not use it in v1:

- `pi-coding-agent` does not depend on it, and it has its own extension API. Pi packages, extensions, skills and settings written for the coding agent don't run on it.
- It has its own transcript format, not the session JSONL that ADR 0006 replicates.
- It is marked experimental, and its API changes without notice between releases.

It is the likely answer to resuming a Session on fresh compute in v2, and the session host is where it would plug in.

## Open-source prior art

### PI WEB

[jmfederico/pi-web](https://github.com/jmfederico/pi-web) is the strongest Pi-native reference. It provides a long-lived Session daemon, full Pi Sessions, workspaces and Git worktrees, remote-machine federation, browser/server plugins, and hosted-session dispatch. Its trust model is personal and explicitly not a multi-tenant sandbox.

### Paddock

[edspencer/paddock](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock) provides useful patterns for Project context, persistent chats, provenance, reconnectable event streams, spawned chats, triggers, and curated Project knowledge. It is Claude-specific.

### Clay Studio

[chadbyte/clay](https://github.com/chadbyte/clay) is useful prior art for multi-user live Sessions, permissions, presence, handoffs, portable on-disk state, push notifications, and optional Linux-user isolation. It is not Pi-native and uses the AGPL-3.0-only license.

### Agentrove

[Mng-dev-ai/agentrove](https://github.com/Mng-dev-ai/agentrove) demonstrates lead chats that spawn worker subthreads, worktree isolation, channels, and Docker or host sandboxes. Its workers remain flat rather than recursively full Project Threads.

### Agent Console

[ms2sato/agent-console](https://github.com/ms2sato/agent-console) demonstrates worktree delegation, parent reporting, cross-session messages, timers, and GitHub webhook routing. Its stated security model is local and personal.

### Ambient Code Platform

[ambient-code/platform](https://github.com/ambient-code/platform) is useful Kubernetes prior art for CRDs, operators, Jobs, namespace-scoped access, and multi-repository outcomes. Its execution model is Job-oriented rather than a full durable Pi Session model.

### OpenHands

[OpenHands/OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) is now Agent Canvas, a self-hosted React UI for coding agents. The backend is the Agent Server in [OpenHands/software-agent-sdk](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk): one REST and WebSocket server per host that runs conversations, stores their events on local disk and can start a Docker container per conversation. Canvas can drive Pi as an ACP subprocess (`pi-acp`).

It is not shaped like Claude Code cloud. There is no control plane: the browser connects to each Agent Server directly and switches between them. That model has three costs Pipoca avoids with an outbound agent and one server ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-provider-protocol.md)):

- Every backend must be reachable from the browser, so remote machines need a tunnel. Their DigitalOcean integration ships a tunnel bridge and a reverse proxy for this.
- The browser keeps a session key per backend in `localStorage`. Their self-hosting guide notes that any script on the same origin can read every key.
- History lives on each backend's disk and is lost with the machine.

Running Pi over ACP also loses what makes a hosted Pi Session worth having: extension prompts, the JSONL tree and personalization ([ADR 0010](adr/0010-session-host-on-bun.md)).

Parts worth reusing:

- Their session socket gives every stored event a sequence number, starts with a sync frame naming the replay range, and resumes from `after_seq`. Streaming deltas may be dropped, and every streaming item ends with exactly one stored message or an abort frame.
- A slow consumer is disconnected instead of being sent fewer frames. Admission is byte-bounded, so one stuck tab cannot stall the publisher, and a reconnect from the cursor loses nothing.
- On restart, an unfinished tool call gets an explicit error result saying a restart interrupted it.
- A conversation lease file holds a generation, a 45 second TTL and the owner's host and pid. A new owner takes over early when that pid is dead, and every write checks ownership first.
- Per-conversation Docker containers sit behind a proxy in the host's Agent Server, each with its own API key and encryption key.
- A storage reclaimer applies a disk budget and retention, moving files to a trash folder before deleting them.
- Automations are a separate service that decides when to run and creates conversations through the public API.
- UI extensions are installed disabled. An agent may install one, but only the user enables it.

### Coder and Daytona

[coder/coder](https://github.com/coder/coder) and [daytonaio/daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) are possible Workspace or sandbox substrates. They do not provide the Pi Session, Project coordinator, Thread report, or Pi personalization model by themselves.

### Kubernetes Claude platforms

Several open-source systems create one Job or pod for a bounded Claude task. They are useful for operator, RBAC, and workspace patterns, but their batch lifecycle does not directly solve durable interactive Pi Sessions.

## Automations and software factories

Read 2026-10-24 (Hermes Agent at `4dcef215`, OpenClaw at `779fe239`) and 2026-11-02 (product docs).

- **Hermes Agent and OpenClaw.** Scheduled work is a job record plus a run record, and each run is a fresh session with an unattended contract: the final reply is the result, and a "nothing to do" reply stays quiet. Both advance the next firing before dispatching it, collapse missed firings into one catch-up run, alert once per error signature, and pause a job that keeps failing. Webhooks fire jobs, with HMAC, coalescing by a key and a delivery-id cache. OpenClaw built a server-side task-flow engine in 2026.3 and removed it in 2026.9.7, turning special-purpose runners into ordinary jobs. Both later added a board of cards with dependencies, worked by agent workers.
- **[Cursor automations](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/automations).** A trigger (schedule, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Slack, Linear, Sentry, PagerDuty or webhook), a prompt, tools and a repository. Each firing is one cloud agent run. "Run as" is the creator or a service account, and only admins pick a service account. Each automation keeps a memory file. Access is private, view or edit.
- **[Factory automations](https://docs.factory.com/automations/custom.md).** Schedule, GitHub, Slack and webhook triggers, each firing one session. Starters such as "Ticket to PR", "Code Health" and "Review Comment Fixer". Runs act as the person or a service account. Five failed runs pause an automation, and webhook runs are capped at 10 an hour with identical bodies ignored for 10 minutes.
- **[Devin with Linear](https://docs.devin.ai/integrations/linear.md).** A ticket starts a session when assigned, labelled `@skills:<name>`, mentioned, or matched by a trigger on team, label and status. A trigger fires only when a ticket newly matches. The skill chosen by the label decides how the work is done.
- **[Copilot coding agent](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-03-06-github-copilot-coding-agent-for-jira-is-now-in-public-preview/).** Assigning an issue, in GitHub or Jira, starts one agent run that opens a draft pull request through its GitHub App.
- **[GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/index.html).** A Markdown file with triggers in frontmatter and a prompt as its body, compiled to an Actions workflow. The agent is read-only; the writes it declares ("safe outputs") are applied by a separate job after a scan. Credit caps per run and per day.

None of these puts a planning agent between an event and the run it starts.

### Bot identities on GitHub

- A GitHub App can be created from a [manifest](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest/): the server posts a form to GitHub, GitHub redirects back with a code, and the code is exchanged for the App's id, private key and webhook secret. [RunsOn](https://runs-on.com/blog/self-serve-github-app-registration-with-manifests/) uses this so each customer has a private App of their own in two clicks.
- [Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/github-apps) lists several Apps per host, each with `allowedInstallationOwners`, and allows one per organization because it picks an App by organization.
- GitHub's terms allow [one free machine account per person](https://conductatlas.com/platform/github/github-terms-of-service/machine-account-limited-to-one-per-user/).

### Multiplayer sessions

Read 2026-11-03 (product docs and papers).

- **[Claude Tag](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/when-claude-responds.md).** A mention starts a session, and every reply in its thread reaches it. At a channel's top level the model decides whether to answer, and "nothing" is the usual outcome. `!mute` silences a thread, and a thread can be set to answer only when mentioned ([commands](https://claude.com/docs/claude-tag/users/commands.md)).
- **[Devin in Slack](https://docs.devin.ai/integrations/slack.md).** Thread replies reach the session. `!aside` on a message hides it from Devin, the only per-message exclusion found.
- **ChatGPT group chats.** The model decided when to answer, and a mention forced a reply ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/group-chats-in-chatgpt/)). OpenAI is retiring the feature ([notice](https://help-lb.openai.com/en/articles/12703475-retiring-group-chats-in-chatgpt)).
- **[llmcord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakobdylanc/llmcord/main/README.md) and Open WebUI.** A mention triggers the bot, which reads the last 25 to 50 messages.
- **[Amp](https://ampcode.com/docs/collaborate/multiplayer).** Members of a shared thread can talk to each other in it, and a long thread is handed off to a new one.
- **Addressee detection.** GPT-4o found who a message was addressed to at 80.9% against an 80.6% chance baseline in three-person conversations ([Inoue et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.16643v2)).

No product has votes: the agent asks, and the first answer wins with the answerer's name.

## Research conclusion

No reviewed project combines Pi-native Session fidelity, Claude-style Projects and Threads, portable Environments, strong Kubernetes execution, and future collaboration. PI WEB is the closest reference; Pipoca owns its own control plane and UI rather than building on it ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-own-the-control-plane-and-ui.md)).
