# Existing Pi ecosystem

> Status: integration context. These are existing capabilities Pipoca may reuse or adapt. Reuse is not yet a decision to depend on a particular implementation.

## Pi core

Pi supplies the Session runtime:

- full independent `AgentSession` instances;
- native persistent JSONL transcripts;
- SDK and long-lived RPC integration;
- explicit working directories;
- new, open, continue, branch, clone, and fork operations;
- streaming lifecycle and tool events;
- steering and queued follow-ups;
- extension loading and permission dialogs;
- model, effort, tool, skill, and resource selection;
- compaction and clean settlement boundaries.

Pipoca should host and orchestrate this runtime rather than implement a second agent loop.

## pi-subagents

`pi-subagents` provides nested delegation inside one Pi Session. A Session may launch bounded children, workflows, review fanout, and isolated worktrees.

Its project-pane feature already proves the hierarchy Pipoca needs: a parent Pi Session can open a peer Pi Session rooted in another repository, and that peer owns its own subagents. The parent coordinates it but does not own the peer's nested children.

Project panes are a useful proof and possible prototype primitive. They are not a complete Project model: pane bindings do not provide a durable Project identity, Thread registry, shared instructions and memory, structured reports, routing, provider scheduling, or recovery across machines.

Pipoca must keep this distinction:

```text
Project Thread
  full peer Pi Session
    nested pi-subagents work
```

A Thread is never represented as an ordinary subagent run.

## pi-repos

`pi-repos` owns repository inventory and topology:

- canonical repository identities and paths;
- local and cloned repositories;
- groups of related repositories;
- directional connections;
- references;
- summaries and annotations;
- cross-repository search;
- group architecture documents.

A pi-repos Group describes a software system. A Pipoca Project describes an ongoing stream of work on that system. They may be linked, but they are not the same resource.

Pipoca may use pi-repos as an adapter for repository discovery, group context, and topology. Workspace provisioning and Session worktree ownership remain Pipoca runtime concerns.

## pi-task

`pi-task` provides durable implementation plans and task DAGs across Sessions:

- phases and dependencies;
- readiness and blockers;
- acceptance criteria;
- executor hints;
- progress that survives context resets.

A Project may link to a pi-task plan, and a Thread may reference one or more tasks. Pipoca should not make every plan task a Session or duplicate the task graph in Project infrastructure.

Projects coordinate conversations and execution; task plans describe work and verification.

## pi-memory

`pi-memory` stores curated durable facts and preferences. It deliberately excludes Session progress, repository-derived facts, and credentials.

Pipoca Project memory has a different scope: Project requirements, decisions, coordination preferences, and pitfalls shared across Thread Sessions. The two stores should not be silently merged. Any promotion between them should be explicit and attributable.

## pi-focus

`pi-focus` records a Session's semantic goal, current activity, next step, waiting or blocked state, and handoff. It also tracks top-level long-running tools without storing their output.

This can inform Session status and structured Thread reports, but Pipoca should not infer Project completion or verification from a focus state alone.

## pi-github

`pi-github` provides typed GitHub operations, CI/check handling, and session-scoped authority. Pipoca may reuse its policy and operation seams for GitHub integration.

A cloud control plane introduces additional credential concerns. Provider-local or brokered Git credentials should remain scoped and should not be replaced by broad tokens mounted into every Session merely because a GitHub extension exists.

## pi-web candidates

The reviewed PI WEB implementations show that Pi can be hosted through a browser with persistent Sessions, workspaces, worktrees, extension questions, and remote runtimes.

`jmfederico/pi-web` is the strongest current reference for:

- a long-lived Session daemon separate from the browser/API process;
- multiple full Pi Sessions;
- projects and workspaces;
- Git worktrees;
- remote-machine federation;
- browser and server plugins;
- hosted-session dispatch and messaging.

Its trust model is personal and explicitly not a multi-tenant sandbox. Pipoca owns its control plane and UI and treats PI WEB as a reference ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-own-the-control-plane-and-ui.md)).

## Likely integration boundaries

| Capability                | Existing owner                                                              | Possible Pipoca role                            |

| Nested delegation         | Pipoca's `subagents` plugin ([ADR 0057](adr/0057-pipocas-own-subagents.md)) | Available inside every hosted Session           |
| Repository topology       | pi-repos                                                                    | Adapter for discovery and shared system context |
| Work planning             | pi-task                                                                     | Optional Project and Thread linkage             |
| Curated personal facts    | pi-memory                                                                   | Separate from Project coordination memory       |
| Semantic Session activity | pi-focus                                                                    | Status signal and report input                  |
| GitHub operations         | pi-github                                                                   | Policy-aware integration seam                   |
| Browser Session host      | PI WEB                                                                      | Candidate foundation or prototype host          |

These boundaries favor deletion and reuse. Pipoca should add distributed control, Projects, Environments, Profiles, Workspaces, runners, and extension interfaces only where the existing modules do not already own the behavior.
