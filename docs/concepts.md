# Pipoca concepts

> Status: working model. These terms exist to keep future discussions precise. Their interfaces and storage formats are not decided.

## Resource model

### Cell

One logical Pipoca installation. The first Cell has one owner and one authoritative control plane. It may use several Runtime Providers.

### Control Plane

Deterministic infrastructure software that stores desired state, assigns work, enforces leases, routes messages and approvals, and exposes the web/API surface. It does not reason about a Project goal; a coordinator Pi session does that.

### Profile

A Pi agent folder in the server's config folder, at `profiles/<id>/`: Pi packages, instructions and system prompt, MCP servers, model configuration, and preferences, without credentials. A Profile belongs to one user or is shared by an admin, and every user has the shared `default` Profile, which is plain Pi until an admin edits it. It has no revisions: a Session's Pi process loads its current content each time it starts. Under every Profile load an admin's base Profile and then the person's My defaults, a folder of their own at `people/<user id>/defaults/`. A Profile can also build on another Profile, up to 4 deep, and gets everything from it. The nearer layer wins, and trusted project configuration and the Session's own picks layer over all of them ([ADR 0031](adr/0031-profiles.md), [ADR 0041](adr/0041-profiles-as-folders.md), [ADR 0044](adr/0044-base-profile.md), [ADR 0063](adr/0063-settings-and-first-run-setup.md#profiles-in-layers)).

### Runtime Provider

An adapter that supplies execution capacity. Expected provider types include a local host agent, a remote VM agent, and a Kubernetes namespace controller. Its Provider Agent connects outbound, advertises capabilities and capacity, claims assignments, manages provider-local Runtimes and Workspaces, and streams Session events.

### Environment

An execution definition plus a pool of runners that serve it. It may define an image, a setup script, variables, secrets, isolation (process or container), capacity, and Workspace storage. It has no revisions [ADR 0032](adr/0032-environments-and-runners.md).

Sessions target an Environment, not a specific machine or pod. In v1 an Environment has exactly one Provider ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-concept-map-and-environments.md)). In v2 it is a pool of runners [ADR 0032](adr/0032-environments-and-runners.md).

### Runtime

A live realization of an Environment capable of hosting one or more sessions. Depending on Environment policy, a Runtime may be a local process host, a shared runner pod, a dedicated session pod, or a bounded Job.

### Repository

A Git repository a Session works on, identified by its clone URL. A Session may have several, checked out side by side in its Workspace ([ADR 0015](adr/0016-projects.md)).

### Workspace

The durable filesystem and repository state owned by a session. A Workspace may resolve to a local Git worktree, VM directory, shared-volume directory, or Kubernetes PVC. The control plane stores a stable reference rather than assuming one universal path.

### Session

One full Pi conversation with its own transcript, context, model state, Profile, Environment revision, Workspace, active attempt, and lifecycle. A Session may be independent or related to a Project.

The Session is where the other concepts meet. Project, Repository, Environment and Profile are peers that a Session points at; none contains another ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-concept-map-and-environments.md)).

### Attempt

One Runtime assignment for a Session. A replacement Runtime creates a new attempt. This records interruptions honestly and provides fencing against two Runtimes executing the same Session after a network partition.

### Project

A long-running goal with one coordinator Session, zero or more thread Sessions, shared instructions, memory, one or more repositories, and a default Environment ([ADR 0015](adr/0016-projects.md)). The coordinator is model-driven and interprets the goal; it is not the deterministic Control Plane.

### Thread

A full Session attached to a Project to own one area of work. A Thread can run its own subagents and workflows. Its detailed transcript stays in the Thread. The coordinator gets a short notice when the Thread finishes a turn or changes state, and the Thread can message the coordinator directly. The user can also talk to a Thread directly. Threads and the coordinator show only inside their Project, never in the Session list ([ADR 0028](adr/0028-projects-around-the-coordinator.md)).

### Kernel and Plugin

The kernel is what every installation needs: Sessions, Environments, providers, Workspaces, terminals, events, server tools, the start request and the web shell. Every other feature, Projects included, is a Plugin with up to three parts: on the server, inside the Pi session as a Pi extension, and in the web UI ([ADR 0015](adr/0015-plugins.md)).

### Subagent

Child execution owned by one Session. Subagents are useful internal implementation machinery, not Project Threads.

### Automation

A future capability that starts or continues ordinary Session turns in response to time, webhooks, APIs, or prior run results. It should use the same run interface as a human or Project coordinator.

## Control-plane topology

There is normally one logical control plane per Cell. Provider Agents initiate authenticated outbound connections so laptops, VMs, and namespace-scoped cluster agents can work behind NATs and firewalls.

```mermaid

    USER[Browser, phone, CLI] --> CP[Control Plane]
    LAP[Laptop Provider Agent] -->|outbound| CP
    VM[VM Provider Agent] -->|outbound| CP
    K8S[Kubernetes Provider Agent] -->|outbound| CP

    LAP --> LS[Local Pi Sessions]
    VM --> VS[VM Pi Sessions]
    K8S --> KS[Kubernetes Pi Sessions]
```

The control plane owns identity, Project and Session records, Environment revisions, Profiles, assignments, leases, shared Project state, and browser event routing. Providers own execution, Pi processes, Workspace realization, and provider-local credentials. See [Working architecture](architecture.md) for the detailed responsibility and lifecycle model.

## Session configuration

The current working precedence is:

1. mandatory Pipoca session bridge;
2. installation policy;
3. selected Profile;
4. selected Environment overlay;
5. trusted project configuration;
6. explicit Session overrides.

The exact merge rules remain undecided. The effective configuration should be inspectable and reproducible.

## Environment selection

The current working precedence is:

1. explicit Session or Thread override;
2. Project default Environment;
3. user default Environment;
4. installation default.

A Project may eventually select different defaults for its coordinator and worker Threads.

## Execution isolation

Environment policy may support several modes behind one Session interface:

| Mode           | Likely implementation                                       | Intended use                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Shared process | Several Pi session processes in one trusted Runtime         | Personal fast path                 |
| Dedicated pod  | One full Session per pod, with subagents inside it          | Isolation and resource accounting  |
| Batch Job      | Fresh bounded execution that publishes outcomes before exit | Schedules and verification         |
| Hardened       | Dedicated sandboxed pod or microVM                          | Untrusted code or stronger tenancy |

No default mode has been chosen. See [Environments](environments.md) for setup, revision, network, secret, capability, and Workspace policy.

## Durable and ephemeral state

Control-plane state includes identifiers, relationships, revisions, assignments, status, shared memory, and artifact indexes.

Pi transcripts remain native JSONL and should be replicated or backed up without inventing a competing transcript format.

Workspaces remain provider-managed durable state. Live processes, shell commands, and subagents are ephemeral. Runtime reconstruction restores persisted conversation and files, not process memory.

See [Extensibility](extensibility.md) for the Profile, Session bridge, platform extension, automation, and collaboration model.
