# Pipoca guide

How to run Pipoca and what each part of it does, in more detail than the [README](../README.md). The design behind it is in [architecture.md](architecture.md) and the decision records in [adr/](adr/).

## Run it on your laptop

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) and a working Pi setup with at least one model you can log in to.

```sh
bun install
bun run build
apps/pipoca/dist/pipoca server
```

The first time it starts, the server logs a setup link (`open the setup link to create the first user`). Open it to create your user; the link works once. After that, the page asks for that name and password, and a browser stays signed in for 30 days. Ten wrong passwords for a name from one address lock that name there for 15 minutes, and 50 wrong passwords from one address, for any names, lock that address. A person signing in from somewhere else isn't locked out.

On the Environments page, make an Environment named `laptop`. The page shows its key once, in the command that starts an agent:

```sh
PIPOCA_KEY=pck_… apps/pipoca/dist/pipoca agent --name laptop --folder ~/code/my-project
```

Then open New session, type what Pi should do, pick `~/code/my-project` in the folder chip (and the `laptop` Environment, when there is more than one), and press Enter. The composer remembers what you picked for next time. A session runs in the Environment it was created in ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-concept-map-and-environments.md)).

The agent only runs sessions in the folders you list with `--folder`, or in folders inside them. One `--folder ~/code` covers every checkout under it, and the folder chip lists the git checkouts it finds there, after the ones you used recently. The workspace follows from what you pick ([ADR 0040](adr/0040-fewer-forms.md)). A folder gets its own Git worktree, on a branch named `pipoca/` plus the first 8 characters of the session id, stored under the agent's data directory. Tick "Share the folder" in the chip to run in the folder itself; sessions sharing a folder this way can step on each other's changes. A pasted repository URL gets a fresh clone. Two or more URLs check each one out side by side in one workspace, all on the session's branch: as a worktree of a checkout under a listed folder whose remote is that repository, or as a fresh clone when none is. The Changes panel then shows each repository on its own, and archiving deletes the workspace only if none of them would lose work and no other files sit beside them.

### In a session

In a session, Enter queues a message for when Pi finishes its turn, and Ctrl+Enter (⌘Enter on a Mac) sends it now, so Pi reads it after its current step. On a phone, Enter starts a new line and the send button sends. A queued message can be taken back or sent now. The header shows the session's token use and cost (the `usage` plugin), and its Diff button opens the Changes panel with what the session changed in its Git workspace (the `changes` plugin). When the agent delegates to subagents (the `subagents` plugin, [ADR 0030](adr/0030-subagents.md)), each run shows as a card in the chat with its agent, progress and time; open it to see the subagent's steps and output. A chip under the composer counts the runs still going. The plugin loads [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents) in every session, installing it the first time; if you already use pi-subagents, yours is used instead. Pi shows Pi's own terminal UI for the session, so extensions that only work in a terminal work there too, and Terminal opens a shell in the session's directory. For a worktree or clone, the "from" chip picks the branch, tag or commit the session's branch starts at.

### The assistant

The home screen asks the Pipoca assistant (the `meta` plugin, [ADR 0035](adr/0035-meta-sessions.md)). Type a question and press Enter: that starts a meta-session, a session with no repositories that runs on the plugin's own read-only Profile, without Pi's file and shell tools. Before any tool call that could change something, it shows a card with the tool and its whole input and waits for you to allow it; read-only tools run without asking. A meta-session loads only the `ask`, `models` and `meta` session parts, so subagents and `/pr` aren't there. Its tools manage Sessions, Environments, Profiles and Projects through the same routes as the web UI. For an admin, it can also write an in-place plugin into the plugins folder and build it, without running any of its code; turning it on stays yours, on the Plugins page. They never see secret values, runner keys or what a Profile's MCP servers hold. When it starts or opens something, a wide screen goes there, and a phone shows a notice with an Open button. Earlier conversations are listed under the composer and on the Assistant page, not in the session list. "Start a session yourself" opens the New session form.

### MCP clients

The same tools are served over MCP at `/api/mcp`, so Pi or Claude Code on your laptop can manage Pipoca too. Make a token under Settings, MCP clients; it is shown once, with the command that adds the server:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http pipoca https://pipoca.example/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer pcm_..."
```

A client acts as the user who made its token, and asking before risky tools is up to the client. Revoking the token cuts it off at once. The endpoint answers each request with one JSON reply and opens no event stream.

### Projects and the library

Projects (the `projects` plugin, [ADR 0016](adr/0016-projects.md)) group work on one goal. Create one on the Projects page with a name, an Environment, its repository URLs and optional instructions. That starts its coordinator, a session with every repository checked out. Tell the coordinator what you want: it starts a thread session for each piece of work, gets a turn with a short notice after each thread turn, and shares Project memory with the threads. A memory file that exists changes only on top of the revision a session last read, so two writers can't lose each other's change. When Pi compacts the coordinator's context, a fresh coordinator takes over with a handoff in its system prompt: Pi's summary, the latest messages, the threads and the memory index. Start fresh in the Project's settings does the same by hand, and the settings list each earlier conversation ([ADR 0052](adr/0052-the-assistant-as-a-project.md#coordinators-are-swapped-not-compacted)). The Projects page lists the threads with their run and work state and highlights the ones that need you. You can open any thread and talk to it directly. The Library page (the `library` plugin, [ADR 0018](adr/0018-project-library.md)) holds files shared by a Project: upload them there, and Project sessions get them with `fetch_file` and add their own with `publish_file`.

### Fork and archive

Fork, in a session's menu, works like Pi's `/fork`. Pick one of your messages, newest first, and a new session starts that remembers the chat up to that message, with the message back in its composer to edit and send. Messages after it and other branches stay behind. "Fork the whole Session" copies the whole chat instead, like Pi's `/clone`. The fork works on its own branch from the forked session's branch.

`POST /api/sessions/<id>/fork` takes an optional `entry`, the id of a user message in the transcript, and answers with the new session and the message's text as `editorText`. Without `entry` it copies the whole transcript. With an `environment` it forks into another Environment; the new machine gets only what the session pushed. A clone session's fork checks out its branch from the remote, so push that branch first; otherwise the fork fails with "Push the Session's branch first".

Archive hides a session from the list and stops it on its machine; its transcript stays readable under "Show archived", and Unarchive picks it up again. Archiving a worktree or clone session also deletes its workspace if Git says nothing would be lost: no uncommitted or untracked files, and every commit pushed. Otherwise the workspace is kept and the session shows "unpushed work" until you delete it yourself; Delete workspace says why it was kept. A clean workspace comes back from its pushed branch when you unarchive. Files listed in a `.worktreeinclude` at the checkout root, such as `.env`, are copied into new worktrees if Git ignores them.

### Server and agent options

Options:

```text
[PIPOCA_SECRET_KEY=<32 bytes, base64>] \
pipoca server [--supervise] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 7420] [--url <public URL>]
                [--database ~/.pipoca/server.db] [--plugins ~/.pipoca/plugins]
                [--trust-proxy]
                [--provider <name> [--data-dir ~/.pipoca/server]
                [--folder <path>]... [--extension <path>]...]
PIPOCA_KEY=<Environment key> | PIPOCA_TOKEN=<runner token> \
pipoca agent --name <runner> [--capacity <n>] [--exit-when-idle <seconds>]
               [--server http://127.0.0.1:7420] [--data-dir ~/.pipoca/agent]
               [--session-binary <path>] [--folder <path>]...
               [--extension <path>]...
```

`--host` is the address the server listens on; use `0.0.0.0` behind a proxy or in a container. `--url` is where people open it, when that differs, so the setup link points there. `--provider` also runs an agent inside the server, in the Environment of that name, which needs no key. `--trust-proxy` counts failed sign-ins by the client address that the proxy in front adds last to `X-Forwarded-For`. Set it only when every request comes through that proxy: otherwise anyone can send the header and pick their address. Without it, behind a proxy, everyone shares the proxy's address. `--supervise` runs the server as a child process and starts it again each time it restarts, so whatever runs `pipoca` sees no exit for a restart; the container image uses it.

### Plugins

`--plugins` is the folder for installed plugins, next to the database by default ([ADR 0022](adr/0022-plugin-model-v2.md#installing-third-party-plugins)). [docs/plugins.md](plugins.md) shows how to write one. Each is a folder named by its id with a `pipoca` manifest in its `package.json`. Install one on the Plugins page from a git repository or a `.tgz` URL, pinned to its commit or SHA-256 in `.source.json` in its folder, or let the assistant write one in place. Update fetches the newest version from the same URL, and Remove works once the plugin isn't running. An installed plugin starts turned off and none of its code runs. Turning it on asks first, listing the capabilities it asks for and where its parts run, and takes effect when the server next starts; `enabled.json` in the folder lists the ones turned on. A plugin that is on is installed and bundled into `.build` each time the server starts, using the server's own binary as `bun`, so the machine needs neither Bun nor npm, and a build error shows on the Plugins page. Restart now on that page makes the server exit with code 75 for whatever runs it to start it again: systemd with `Restart=on-failure`, `pipoca server --supervise`, or `bun run dev`. The container image runs the server with `--supervise`, so in Kubernetes it restarts inside its container and the kubelet doesn't count a restart as a crash and back off. It asks first while a Session on the server's own runner is mid-turn, since that turn is interrupted. The server knows systemd by `INVOCATION_ID`; `--supervise` and the dev loop set `PIPOCA_SUPERVISED=1` for the server they start, which you can set for any other supervisor that restarts on exit. Elsewhere it says to restart the server yourself.

### Keys and tokens

An agent joins the pool of the Environment whose key it holds, under its `--name`, and gets a token of its own for everything else ([ADR 0033](adr/0033-v2-authentication-and-order.md)). Each session it starts gets a token too, which reaches only that session. Replace key on the Environments page lets go of every agent that joined with the old key; start them again with the new one. The agent reads the key from `PIPOCA_KEY` and removes it from what its sessions inherit. A name belongs to one runner in an Environment ([ADR 0032](adr/0032-environments-and-runners.md)). While a runner of that name is online there, the agent prints `a runner named <name> is online here` and exits with code 1; give it another `--name`, or stop the other one and wait until the Environments page shows it offline, about 30 seconds after its last poll. An agent that joins under the name of an offline runner takes it over, and the old runner's token stops working. The agent keeps its token in `runner.json` in its `--data-dir`, readable only by its user, so a restart against the same `--server` with the same key comes back as the same runner without joining. It joins again when that token is gone or refused. A runner token that no agent has polled with for 30 days stops working, so an agent started with the key just joins again, and one started with `PIPOCA_TOKEN` alone needs a new token. A runner that a plugin starts, such as a Kubernetes pod, gets a token in `PIPOCA_TOKEN` instead, and `--exit-when-idle <seconds>` stops it once it has run no session for that long. Tests of the built binary set `PIPOCA_FAUX_REPLY` so every turn answers with that text and no model provider is needed.

### Environment setup and secrets

An Environment can have a setup script, variables and secrets (`PATCH /api/environments/<id>` with `setupScript`, `variables` and `secrets`; a null secret removes it). Each agent runs the setup script once per version before the first session that needs it, and a session's processes and terminals get the variables and secrets. The API lists secret names only. The server encrypts secrets with AES-GCM before it stores them, using the key in `PIPOCA_SECRET_KEY` (`openssl rand -base64 32`), or else one it makes in `server.db.key` next to the database. Losing the key loses every stored secret. A `GH_TOKEN` secret also signs git in to GitHub over https, both for cloning a session's repositories and for the session's own pushes.

Model provider and MCP server logins belong to each person and live on the server, sealed with the same key ([ADR 0045](adr/0045-server-kept-logins.md)). `/login` and `/mcp login` in any Session save the login there, and every Session that person starts uses it, on any runner, so a Kubernetes pod that exits keeps nothing. Runners read and write a login through the server, which lets one runner at a time refresh it, since providers rotate refresh tokens. An MCP sign-in opens on your device; when the server sends you back to an address on the runner, paste the address your browser lands on. Settings lists your logins under Logins, where you can log out of one or connect one of Pi's own model providers without a Session: the server runs Pi's sign-in, the sign-in page opens on your device, and for providers that send you to an address on your own machine you paste the address your browser lands on. Providers that extensions add take `/login` in a Session. The same page lists the MCP servers of the base Profile and your Profiles that sign in with OAuth, each with Sign in: the sign-in page sends your browser back to Pipoca at `<url>/api/plugins/logins/callback`, or, for a client registered with a loopback `callbackUrl`, you paste the address you land on. Servers with a `clientSecret` or `clientRegistration: "cimd"` take `/mcp login` in a Session. With the `logins` plugin off, each runner keeps its own logins in its data folder as before.

### Templates

Admins can share an Environment's settings as a template ([ADR 0049](adr/0049-personal-environments-and-templates.md)): a setup script, isolation, image and variables, but never secrets or runners. Make one under Templates on the Environments page, or list them under `templates` in the config folder's `pipoca.json`, for example from the chart's `config` value:

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "id": "pods",
      "name": "Cluster pods",
      "setupScript": "apt-get install -y ripgrep",
      "variables": { "REGION": "eu" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Anyone can then make an Environment from a template, by picking it next to New Environment or with `"template": "<id>"` in `POST /api/environments`. That Environment is theirs, with their own secrets, variables and runners. Its setup script, isolation and image come from the template, and the template's variables sit under its own. A change to a template reaches each of those Environments when a Session next starts. If a template is deleted, its Environments go back to their own settings.

### Containers

With `isolation: "container"`, each session's Pi process runs in a container from the Environment's `image` (default `node:22-bookworm`; any image with glibc, bash and git works), as the agent's user, with the agent's data directory, its `--folder`s and the workspace mounted at the same paths. The agent needs Docker. It mounts its own Linux binary into the container, so a Linux agent built with `bun run build` needs nothing else, and an agent on a Mac or run from source needs `--session-binary <path to a Linux pipoca binary>`. The setup script then runs once in the image as root, and sessions run in the image it leaves. Terminals open a shell in the session's container.

### Runner pools

Several agents can join one Environment's pool with its key ([ADR 0032](adr/0032-environments-and-runners.md)). `--capacity` caps how many sessions the agent runs at once. A session in a folder goes to an agent that lists the folder, and a session that has run goes back to the agent it ran on. A clone or several-repositories session moves to another agent in the pool if its agent stops polling for a minute; it starts again from its transcript in a fresh checkout of its branch, so only pushed work comes along. An agent that can't reach the server for 30 seconds stops those sessions itself, so two agents never run one session.

## Run it in Kubernetes

The `Dockerfile` builds an image that runs the server, and `deploy/helm/pipoca` installs it with one replica and its data on a ReadWriteOnce volume ([ADR 0034](adr/0034-v2-deployment-and-credentials.md)). On install the chart makes a Secret holding the secret key, and it keeps that Secret on upgrades and uninstalls. Put HTTPS in front with your gateway, and set `url` to where people open it. When every request comes through that gateway, `trustProxy=true` counts failed sign-ins by the client address it forwards:

```sh
helm install pipoca deploy/helm/pipoca --set url=https://pi.example.com
kubectl logs deploy/pipoca | grep setup
```

### On Kyma

On Kyma, `apiRule.enabled` puts the server behind Kyma's gateway at `apiRule.host`, and `url` defaults to that host:

```sh
helm install pipoca deploy/helm/pipoca --namespace pipoca --create-namespace \
  --set apiRule.enabled=true --set apiRule.host=pipoca.<cluster domain>
```

The gateway lets through only what a browser needs: the web UI, sign-in and the `/api` routes it calls. The setup link, the runner routes under `/agent` and `/api/mcp` stay closed, so open the setup link through `kubectl port-forward svc/pipoca 7420`. Runner pods reach the server through its Service, and the chart adds an Istio policy that lets pods in the namespace reach `/agent`, since the APIRule's own policies only let the gateway in. Sign-ins come only through the gateway, so the chart trusts the client address it forwards. `apiRule.exposeAgents=true` opens `/agent` for runners outside the cluster, such as a laptop, and `apiRule.exposeMcp=true` opens `/api/mcp` for MCP clients.

### Single sign-on

To sign in through OpenID Connect providers, such as SAP IAS, Okta or Google ([ADR 0038](adr/0038-single-sign-on-and-admins.md)), register `<url>/api/plugins/oidc/callback` as the redirect URI with each provider. An admin adds each provider in Settings, under Single sign-on: its issuer, client ID, a client secret only if the provider requires one (the plugin uses PKCE), and who gets in, by groups from the ID token or by verified email and domain. Each provider gets its own button on the sign-in page. Link your own user from Settings first, then `oidc.ssoOnly=true` turns the password login off.

Each person sees and uses only their own Environments and Sessions ([ADR 0049](adr/0049-personal-environments-and-templates.md)). An Environment someone makes is theirs, and so is a Session they start. A runner that joins with a join key gets an Environment of the person who made the key. Environments from before belong to the first user, the one the setup link made. Admins see everyone's on the People page in Settings, or with `?people=all` on `/api/environments` and `/api/sessions` and `GET /api/people` for the names, as an outline, without variable values, folders or what a Session was first asked. Its owner or an admin can delete an Environment once all its Sessions are archived (`DELETE /api/environments/<id>`). That revokes its key and its runners' tokens and removes its archived Sessions. Admins can stop, archive and unarchive anyone's Session, but they can't read its transcript, open its terminal or send it a message. A Project, its threads and its library belong to the person who started it.

Settings keeps the providers in the server's `pipoca.json`, in its config folder next to the database ([ADR 0039](adr/0039-plugin-config-files.md)), and you can edit that file by hand too. To come up with providers already set, put them under the chart's `config` value, each with an `id`. The chart writes `config` to the data volume only when no `pipoca.json` is there yet, so after that edit the file or use Settings. A provider that needs a client secret either gets it in Settings, which stores it sealed, or names an environment variable in `clientSecretEnv`, which `extraEnv` or `extraEnvFrom` fills from a Kubernetes Secret:

```yaml
config:
  oidc:
    providers:
      - id: ias
        label: Sign in with SAP
        issuer: https://<tenant>.accounts.ondemand.com
        clientId: <client id>
        accessGroup: pipoca-users
        adminGroup: pipoca-admins
```

### Images and remote runners

Every push to main publishes the image as `ghcr.io/pedroklein/pipoca:main` and `:sha-<commit>`. Agents on other machines join it with an Environment's key, as above. `builtInRunner` also runs a runner inside the server pod, but only with `runnerPods.enabled=false`: a server that can start runner pods leaves its own off and logs why, since its Sessions would share the server pod's files, sealing key included ([ADR 0049](adr/0049-personal-environments-and-templates.md)).

### Runner pods

The kubernetes plugin can start runner pods for an Environment in the server's namespace ([ADR 0032](adr/0032-environments-and-runners.md)). The chart gives the server a service account that may create and delete pods and Secrets there; set `runnerPods.enabled=false` to leave that out. Pods come from a pod template ([ADR 0049](adr/0049-personal-environments-and-templates.md)): an admin turns on runner pods in a template's Kubernetes section under Templates on the Environments page, or saves its settings:

```sh
curl <server>/api/plugins/kubernetes/templates/<template id> \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' --cookie <session cookie> \
  -d '{"settings": {"workspace": "pod", "capacity": 1, "maxPods": 5, "idleSeconds": 300, "podPatch": {}}}'
```

`{"settings": null}` turns them off again. Each person then makes an Environment from that template and gets pods of their own, which never serve anyone else; `maxPods` applies to each Environment. Only an Environment made from a pod template shows a Kubernetes section, read-only. An Environment that had Kubernetes settings of its own before templates keeps them, at `/api/plugins/kubernetes/environments/<environment id>`, until an admin removes them.

When some of its Sessions can't go to any runner, the plugin starts one pod for each `capacity` of them, up to `maxPods`. A pod runs the Environment's image, or the Pipoca image when it names none, with the `pipoca` binary copied in. Its agent stops after `idleSeconds` without a Session, and the plugin then deletes the pod and its token. A pod that hasn't started after 10 minutes is deleted too. When a pod fails, or stops without its agent ever reaching the server, the next pod for that Environment waits 10 seconds, twice as long after each failure in a row up to about 5 minutes, and the Environment's Kubernetes section shows why. `podPatch` is a JSON merge patch on the pod, such as `{"spec": {"nodeSelector": {"pool": "agents"}}}`; it can't give the pod a service account token. Only admins change these settings, since a patch can still mount the namespace's Secrets. Pods run Sessions as processes, so the Environment's isolation must be `process`. With `"workspace": "pod"`, the default, a workspace lives only as long as its pod, so use clone or repositories workspaces there. With `"workspace": "claim"`, each Session gets a pod of its own, named after it, whose home is a claim of `claimSize` (with `storageClass`, or the cluster's default). If that pod stops or is deleted, the plugin starts it again with the same claim, and the claim goes once the Session is archived.

After a `helm upgrade`, the server compares the Pipoca image each runner pod copied its binary from with its own, at start and on every pass. It deletes a pod whose image differs, even mid-turn, and the plugin starts a new one, so no pod runs an old binary against the new server. The pod gets a grace period of 30 seconds: its agent stops its Sessions first, waiting up to 10 seconds for each, and a tool cut off is recorded as interrupted by a restart. Once the pod is gone its token is revoked, and a Session with its own claim goes on in the new pod. The server compares the image digests the nodes ran, its own pod's found by the `POD_NAME` the chart sets, so a moving tag such as `main` works too. While a digest isn't known yet, such as for a pod still starting, it compares the image names in the pod specs. A `podPatch` that lowers `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` should leave more than 10 seconds. Pods of an Environment whose settings were removed are left to stop on their own.
